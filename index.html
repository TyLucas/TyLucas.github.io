                <p class="about-me-desc">
                    I am a 20 year old in my third year of college. 
                    My current goal is to learn more web development languages to assist me in my plans to become a full stack developer.
                    Although I do not have much experience in the field right now, that does not stop my from being a constant learner.
                    I understand that being successful in this industry takes time and consistensy, which is why I set my education as
                    my top priority. Because I am hard-working and dedicated to what I do, I know that with time I will be a great engineer.
                    With my experience in management and customer service, I also bring to the table the other side of the spectrum. I know what it is like
                    to make deadlines and work with efficiency. Along with this, I see the needs of all of my coworkers and take pride and making
                    the workplace an enjoyable, yet focused environment. I pride myself in my work ethic and dedication to completing tasks, which over time,
                    will become more apparent.
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-desc" style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    In regards to leadership, I believe that the term can be defined as having the ability to inspire.
                    It is not the person which people follow, but rather their actions. Setting a good example, whether it be in the
                    workplace or not, shows peers what you stand for and how you operate. What's unique about leadership is that
                    everyone has their own unique way of leading, or inspiring others.                    
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-desc" style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    With all of that said, I truly believe I bring the best of both worlds; technical and interpersonal.
                    I task myself with the responsibility of bringing project visions to reality as well as ensuring the team
                    meets deadlines and delivers on their promise to the company. A track record of constantly aiming above an beyond
                    makes me the perfect fit for your next project.
